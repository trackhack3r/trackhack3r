☆ my pronouns are she/her but i don't mind being being called as they/them too (cause i usually use alot of male characters as my ponies in PT.) 

☆ i am an artist/writer who's over 18 as well and i usually draw original characters most entirely. also i'm a straight ally, i fully support lgbtq!!

☆ i heavily kin 007n7 from forsaken. i'm also a yumejoshi (non-sharing mostly) and i also love canon x oc.

☆ i'm a semi-verbal/non-verbal so i'll barely talk unless you're one of my close friends cause i'm very introverted

☆ i don't mind if you guys do some c+h with me and please do c+h ships with me as well (especially 77noli and pizzaburger if i'm on my 007n7 skins.) non-007n7 ships are also allowed to c+h with me if i have a forsaken pony that you ship with a forsaken pony you have.

☆ i'm a very sensitive person so pls make sure to interact with extreme caution to me and i feel very uncomfortable if you're asking me some personal things especially if i don't know you that much pls do not do that!

☆ if you fit the basic dni criteria.

☆ if you are going to harass me or my friends for no damn reason.

☆ if you ship something that's problematic (especially c00lkidd and 007n7 from forsaken).

☆ if you hate oc x canon or even hate ocs in general, let people do what they want and love which makes them happy.

☆ if you disrespect my ships or you're just basically a weirdo.

☆ please do not ever copy or steal my skins and style on pt! i made all the skins myself unless i say it's a tut skin and pls do not take inspo without my permission if you are a close friend of mine, i wouldn't mind letting you take inspo of my skins/style unless you ask for some permission.

☆ if i have iwec/dniup on my name that means i'm in a bad mood or my anxiety is rising especially if there are bad things that happened irl. i'm usually afk at times.
